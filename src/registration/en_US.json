  "STEP0": "Introduction",
  "STEP0_DESCRIPTION": "We appreciate that you want to become a part of the openSenseMap project and that you want to register your own senseBox or weather station. Before you register we want to tell you which data we collect from you.<br><br>When you register you have to include your name, a valid e-mail address and the location of your senseBox.<br><br>The e-mail address is required to send you your Arduino sketch and to inform you about improvements and updates. Your e-mail address will not be passed on to thrid parties and can’t be seen by other users.<br><br>The location is used to show where your senseBox is on the map. This information is important because it allows to reference your collected data to other data sources. The location of your senseBox can be seen by all users or can be accessed through the <a href='https://api.opensensemap.org’ target=’_blank’>API. All data will be stored in data centers of the <a href='https://www.uni-muenster.de/en/' target='_blank'>University of Münster</a>. Backups are stored in S3 on <a href='https://aws.amazon.com'>Amazon Web Services (AWS)</a> in the Frankfrut region. More information on the AWS regions can be found <a href='https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/global-infrastructure/' target='_blank'>here</a>.",
