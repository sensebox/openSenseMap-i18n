If other cookies (such as those used to analyze your surfing behavior) are also stored, they will be treated separately in this privacy policy.</p><h3>Server log files</h3><p>The website provider automatically collects and stores information that your browser automatically transmits to us in \"server log files\".

For this purpose, the information generated by the cookie about the use of this website is stored on our server. The IP address is anonymized before it is stored.</p><p>Matomo cookies remain on your device until you delete them.</p><p>The storage of Matomo cookies is based on Art. 6 (1) (f) DSGVO.

You can prevent these cookies being stored by selecting the appropriate settings in your browser. However, we wish to point out that doing so may mean you will not be able to enjoy the full functionality of this website.</p><p>If you do not agree with the storage and use of your data, you can disable this feature here. In this case, an opt-out cookie will be stored in your browser to prevent Matomo from storing your usage data. If you delete your cookies, this will mean that the opt-out cookie will also be deleted.

Newsletter</h2><h3>Newsletter data</h3><p>If you would like to receive our newsletter, we require a valid email address as well as information that allows us to verify that you are the owner of the specified email address and that you agree to receive this newsletter. No additional data is collected or is only collected on a voluntary basis. We only use this data to send the requested information and do not pass it on to third parties.</p><p>We will, therefore, process any data you enter onto the contact form only with your consent per Art. 6 (1) (a) DSGVO. You can revoke consent to the storage of your data and email address as well as their use for sending the newsletter at any time, e.g. through the \"unsubscribe\" link in the newsletter. The data processed before we receive your request may still be legally processed.</p><p>The data provided when registering for the newsletter will be used to distribute the newsletter until you cancel your subscription when said data will be deleted. Data we have stored for other purposes (e.g. email addresses for the members area) remain unaffected.</p><h3>MailChimp</h3><p></p><p>MailChimp is a service which organizes and analyzes the distribution of newsletters. If you provide data (e.g. your email address) to subscribe to our newsletter, it will be stored on MailChimp servers in the USA.</p><p>MailChimp is certified under the EU-US Privacy Shield. The Privacy Shield is an agreement between the European Union (EU) and the US to ensure compliance with European privacy standards in the United States.</p><p>We use MailChimp to analyze our newsletter campaigns. When you open an email sent by MailChimp, a file included in the email (called a web beacon) connects to MailChimp's servers in the United States. This allows us to determine if a newsletter message has been opened and which links you click on. In addition, technical information is collected (e.g. time of retrieval, IP address, browser type, and operating system). This information cannot be assigned to a specific recipient. It is used exclusively for the statistical analysis of our newsletter campaigns. The results of these analyses can be used to better tailor future newsletters to your interests.</p><p>If you do not want your usage of the newsletter to be analyzed by MailChimp, you will have to unsubscribe from the newsletter. For this purpose, we provide a link in every newsletter we send. You can also unsubscribe from the newsletter directly on the website.</p><p>Data processing is based on Art. 6 (1) (a) DSGVO. You may revoke your consent at any time by unsubscribing to the newsletter. The data processed before we receive your request may still be legally processed.</p><p>The data provided when registering for the newsletter will be used to distribute the newsletter until you cancel your subscription when said data will be deleted from our servers and those of MailChimp. Data we have stored for other purposes (e.g. email addresses for the members area) remains unaffected.</p><p>For details, see the MailChimp privacy policy at <a href=\"https://mailchimp.com/legal/terms/\" target=\"_blank\">https://mailchimp.com/legal/terms/</a>.</p><p><strong>Completion of a data processing agreement</strong></p><p>We have entered into a data processing agreement with MailChimp, in which we require MailChimp to protect the data of our customers and not to disclose said data to third parties. This agreement may be viewed at the following link: <a href=\"https://mailchimp.com/legal/forms/data-processing-agreement/sample-agreement/\" target=\"_blank\">https://mailchimp.com/legal/forms/data-processing-agreement/sample-agreement/</a>.</p>",
